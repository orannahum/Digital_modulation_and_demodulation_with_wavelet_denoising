# digital_modulation_and_demodulation_with_wavelet_denoising
digital modulation and demodulation with wavelet denoising(MATLAB)

The program has 4 digital modulations: QAM, FSK, ASK, PSK
Each modulation has 3 functions: 
1.modulation
2.channel
3.demodulation

You can change the modulation level (M). You can see the effect of lowering the noise of the wobble on each of the modulations.
  

good luck!
